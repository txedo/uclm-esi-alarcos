  comment = {Alexander himself, in his seminal book (Alexander et al, 1978), describes
	a pattern called “Network of Learning”. The premise of this pattern
	is that in a society which emphasises teaching, learners become passive
	and unable to think or act for themselves. He argues that creative,
	active individuals can only grow up in a society which emphasises
	learning instead of teaching. The solution he proposes is to replace
	the structures of compulsory schooling in a fixed place, with decentralised
	processed of learning which engage learners through contact with
	many places and people all over the city: workshops, teachers at
	home, professionals will to take on the young as helpers, older children,
	museums, youth groups, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops,
	old people, and so on. This argument resonates with Ilich's call
	for “deschooling society” (1971) and conviviality (1973).},

  abstract = {When scholars write the history of the world twenty years from now,
	what will they say was the most crucial development at the dawn of
	the 21st century--the attacks of 9/11, or the convergence of technology
	and events that allowed India, China, and so many other countries
	to become part of the global supply chain for services and manufacturing,
	creating an explosion of wealth in the middle classes of the world's
	two biggest nations, and giving them a huge new stake in the success
	of globalization? And with this 'flattening' of the globe, has the
	world gotten too small and too fast for human beings and their political
	systems to adjust in a stable manner? Friedman explains how the flattening
	of the world happened; what it means to countries, companies, communities,
	and individuals; and how governments and societies can, and must,
	adapt.
	
	Includes index.
	
	Pt. [1]: How the world became flat. While I was sleeping -- The ten
	forces that flattened the world: 11/9/89 (when the walls came down
	and the windows went up) ; 8/9/95 (when Netscape went public) ; Work

	Search) ; The steroids (digital, mobile, personal, and virtual) --
	The triple convergence -- The great sorting-out. -- Pt. [2]: America
