It is extremely important, in order to get the application working properly, to associate "id" attributes from both entity and graphic model.
label.general_information_about_mappings2 = To start, the entity and the graphic model that will be linked must be choosen. Then, a list of elements will apear behind them related to the configurable attributes or dimensions. To create the association, select an entity attribute and a graphich model dimension and fill in the required data. Once all associations has been created, click the "next" button at the bottom of this page.
