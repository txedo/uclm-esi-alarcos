== Configure installed JRE in Eclipse ==

  # Now, we are going to add a new JRE definition. Click _Add... -> Standard VM_
  # Search for the JRE home. This path should actually point to the JDK directory. For instance, _C:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x_xx_
  # Check the added JRE definition.

== Configure and edit eclipse.ini ==
  # Close Eclipse.
  # Go to the eclipse installation directory and open the file _eclipse.ini_.
  # Add *two lines* above the _-vmargs_ line:
{{{
-vm
C:/Program Files/Java/jdkx.x.x_xx/bin/javaw
}}}

== Installing m2eclipse plug-in ==

  # Open Eclipse.
  # Go to _Help -> Install New Software..._ and add a new repository.
  # The repository location must be _http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e/_
  # Install _Maven Integration for Eclipse".
